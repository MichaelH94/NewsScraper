# New York Times News Scraper
Assignment for the KU Coding Bootcamp

This is a web based app built with Bootstrap for styling, and Node, Express and Handlebars for rendering. It scrapes the New York Times World page for headlines and allows you to save and leave comments all on one page.

Demo [here](http://mjh-scraper.herokuapp.com/).

Usage is fairly simple. The "Scrape" button populates the database, which is then rendered on to the page via handlebars. The "saved" button will render everything you have saved. In order to save an article, simply press "save article" under the headline. You're also able to leave a comment on each article. These comments are more like notes functionally, and can be edited at will. Click on the "add comment" button to start adding comments.
